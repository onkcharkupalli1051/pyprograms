Question 5
A positive integer n is a sum of squares if n = i2 + j2 for integers i,j such that i ≥ 1 and j ≥ 1. For instance, 10 is a sum of squares because 10 = 12 + 32, and so is 25 (32 + 42). On the other hand, 11 and 3 are not sums of squares.

Write a Python function sumofsquares(n) that takes a positive integer argument and returns True if the integer is a sum of squares, and False otherwise.

def sumofsquares(n) :
  i = 1
  while i * i <= n :
    j = 1
    while(j * j <= n) :
      if (i * i + j * j == n) :
        return True
      j = j + 1
    i = i + 1
  return False
